                </h4>
                <p>
                    My first interest in web development began in primary school, where I enjoyed creating simple
                    websites for fun. However, it wasn‚Äôt something I pursued seriously at the time. Over the years, I
                    completed high school and college, eventually finding a job at TPA, where I have been working since
                    2014. After all that, I rediscovered my interest for creating websites. Since 2018, I
                    have been dedicating myself to it more seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to begin by focusing on frontend development. I started with online courses
                    and practicing on my own projects. <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">JavaScript</span>
                    was the
                    first
                    programming language I
                    learned, and
                    together with <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">HTML</span> and <span
                        class="fw-medium fst-italic">CSS</span>, it became
                    the foundation of
                    my understanding
                    of how frontend for web
                    applications are
                    developed. While exploring various frontend solutions, I came across <span
                        class="fw-medium fst-italic">Bootstrap</span>, which significantly
                    helped in designing and structuring various projects, including the site you're currently reading.
                    Along with learning and experimenting, my confidence in using these technologies grew steadily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming in JavaScript brought me a lot of fun, which led me to explore other languages. As a
                    result, I completed an in-person <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">C++</span> course in Warsaw,
                    further broadening my understanding of
                    programming concepts. Working with C++ is quite different from web development. It focuses on areas
                    like embedded programming for various microcontrollers (e.g., car computers, advanced medical
                    machines, etc.), video games, physical simulations, and other fields that require high performance
                    and low-level hardware control. As part of my C++ work, I developed two old school games using SFML
                    library, which you can check
                    out on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Paszczak1987/SFML_snakeGame.git"
                        target="_blank">snakeGame</a> and <a
                        href="https://github.com/Paszczak1987/SFML_arkanoidGame.git" target="_blank">arkanoid</a> (Don't
                    know how to run these? <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#how_to_run_it">Here</a>
                    is how).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At that time, a friend of mine told me about an interesting <span
                        class="fw-medium fst-italic">Java</span> course with favorable financing
                    conditions, so I decided to take part, and that‚Äôs how my journey with Java began. The course
                    introduced me to Java fundamentals, from object-oriented principles to practical applications, and
                    also provided a more comprehensive approach to web application development, including essential
                    skills in working with databases and <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">SQL</span>. This experience
                    broadened my programming skills and helped
                    me understand how software and web applications are built as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may ask, what am I doing now? Well, currently, I am focusing on deepening my knowledge of
                    <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">Python</span>, particularly in building web applications using
                    <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">Django</span>. I'm attending a <a
                        href="https://coderslab.com/en/courses/python-developer" target="_blank">Python
                        Web Developer</a> course at Coders Lab, where I am learning how to create robust and scalable
                    web
                    applications, including developing <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">REST API</span>s that
                    communicate using the HTTP protocol. A key part of
                    this is implementing <span class="fw-medium fst-italic">CRUD</span> (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                    operations, which are fundamental for
                    managing data in web applications. I'm also exploring best practices for handling HTTP requests,
                    authentication, and security. As I continue to work with Django and other Python frameworks, I am
                    enhancing my skills in database integration, deployment, and optimizing application performance to
                    build efficient and scalable systems.

                    Witht this skill stack, I would describe myself as a

                    application, handling both frontend and backend. With Django, Python, and the background of what I
                    learned earlier, I have acquired the skills to build web applications, managing everything from the
                    user interface to server-side logic. This includes developing REST APIs, working with databases, and
                    ensuring smooth performance and security across the entire system.

                            A Full Stack Developer is a versatile software engineer who is capable of working on both
                            the frontend and backend of web applications. They are skilled in a wide range of
                            technologies and can
                            develop the entire application, from the user interface to the server-side logic. On the
                            frontend, they are
                            proficient in languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries such as
                            React or Angular to create
                            interactive and responsive user interfaces. On the backend, they use technologies like
                            Python, Django,
                            Node.js, or Java to handle server-side logic, manage databases, and build APIs. Full Stack
                            Developers are also
                            knowledgeable in areas like version control, cloud services, and deployment practices. They
                            can work
                            independently or as part of a team to create complete, scalable, and efficient web
                            applications, ensuring that both the
                            user-facing and server-side components function seamlessly together.
